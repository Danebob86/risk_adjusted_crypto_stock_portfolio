Maybe it was those stories you heard; Lamborghinis, Ferrari’s and second homes, fortunes made and lost off of 
something you didn’t really know existed up until 12-18 months ago. 

Maybe it’s those eye-popping charts you keep seeing, the ones that go from $1,000 per coin to $20,000 per coin in 
just one month… and the other charts that can go in the opposite direction even quicker.  

Maybe you watch your friends constantly checking their phones and celebrating their newfound riches, freaking 
out about excessive sharp losses, and you just hate feeling left out. 

However you heard about it, it is now clear that cryptocurrency is at least something you should know about —

The objective goal of Team1’s project is to help investors that are new to cryptocurrency determine the appropriate 
weights of stocks and cryptocurrency in their investment portfolio, which will help achieve highest risk-adjusted returns.

stock index and highest performing cryptocurrency, in order to help you achieve your financial goals. 

The following price returns, statistics, modern portfolio theories, and investment simulations will help you better understand
